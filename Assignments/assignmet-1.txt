

1. *Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) and provide examples of its applications.*
   - Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. AI applications include:
     - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for language translation and sentiment analysis.
     - Computer Vision for image and video recognition.
     - Machine Learning algorithms for predictive analytics and pattern recognition.
     - Robotics for automation and decision-making in physical tasks.


2. *Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in ML.*
   - Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs. Example: predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
   - Unsupervised learning doesn't use labeled data; instead, it finds patterns and structures in the data. Example: clustering similar customer behavior without predefined categories.


3. *What is Python? Discuss its main features and advantages.*
   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
   - Main features:
     - Easy-to-read syntax.
     - Extensive standard library.
     - Dynamically typed.
     - Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
     - Cross-platform compatibility.
   - Advantages:
     - Rapid development and prototyping.
     - Large community support.
     - Scalability.
     - Wide range of libraries for AI, ML, web development, etc.


4. *What are the advantages of using Python as a programming language for AI and ML?*
   - Python offers simplicity and readability, making it easier to implement complex algorithms.
   - It has a vast ecosystem of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn for AI and ML tasks.
   - Python's dynamic typing and interpreted nature speed up development and experimentation.


5. *Discuss the importance of indentation in Python code.*
   - Indentation in Python is crucial as it defines the structure and scope of code blocks like loops, functions, and conditional statements.
   - Proper indentation enhances code readability and helps avoid syntax errors.


6. *Define a variable in Python. Provide examples of valid variable names.*
   - A variable in Python is a named storage location used to store data values.
   - Valid variable names:
     - age
     - user_name
     - total_score
     - _variable_name
     - camelCase


7. *Explain the difference between a keyword and an identifier in Python.*
   - Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in Python, like if, else, while, etc.
   - Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, etc., created by the programmer, following certain rules like starting with a letter or underscore.


8. *List the basic data types available in Python.*
   - Integer (int)
   - Float (float)
   - String (str)
   - Boolean (bool)
   - List
   - Tuple
   - Dictionary
   - Set


9. *Describe the syntax for an if statement in Python.*
   - Syntax: 
     python
     if condition:
         # code block to execute if condition is True

     

10. *Explain the purpose of the elif statement in Python.*
    - The elif statement is used in conjunction with if and else to check additional conditions if the preceding if statement is False.
    - It allows for multiple condition checks in a sequence.
